## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project uses a JSON-based data architecture, making it easy for anyone to contribute.

### How to Contribute Data

All game data is stored in `src/data/` as JSON files:

#### Data Structure
- `champions/` - One JSON file per champion (e.g., `Ahri.json`, `Yasuo.json`)
- `lore-characters/` - One JSON file per lore character
- `artifacts/` - One JSON file per legendary artifact
- `runes/` - One JSON file per world rune
- `relations.json` - Relationships between all characters
- `artifact-owners.json` - Artifact ownership data
- `rune-owners.json` - Rune ownership data

#### Name-based Identifiers
Entity `id`s are generated from their names (without accents or special characters):
- Example: "Ahri" → `id: "ahri"`
- Example: "Rek'Sai" → `id: "reksai"`
- The filename matches the entity's `id`

### Contribution Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a new branch** (`git checkout -b fix/typo-in-yasuo-lore`)
3. **Edit the JSON files** with your corrections/additions
4. **Test locally** (`npm run dev`)
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Fix: Corrected Yasuo lore typo'`)
6. **Push to your fork** (`git push origin fix/typo-in-yasuo-lore`)
7. **Open a Pull Request**
